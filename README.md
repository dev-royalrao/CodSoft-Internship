Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization

PROJECT-1

TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Description: The project predicts the survival during the titanic disaster based on socio-economic measures.
Technologies Used: The notebooks uses Descision Tree Classifier.
Results: The Decision Tree Classifer performed well on the test dataset with an accuracy of 89.5%

PROJECT-2

MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

Description: The project predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.
Technologies Used: The notebook uses regression techniques to tackle this problem.
Results: The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics with an accuracy of 99.1%

PROJECT-3

CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Desciption: The project identifys the fraudulent credit card transactions.
Technologies Used: The notebook uses a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
